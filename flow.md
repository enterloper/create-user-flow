# User Creation Flow

### Objectives
- To determine the flow for creating a user through the medium of my.scouting
- To determine the APIs needed to address the concerns raised from the legacy my.scouting 
application
- To agree on the flow for creating a user before implementation
- To determine the best user experience for the user as this could be their first impression of 
the application and organization


### User Flow
At the time of authoring, there are three known ways to create a user presence on the 
respective databases associated with `my.scouting`.
